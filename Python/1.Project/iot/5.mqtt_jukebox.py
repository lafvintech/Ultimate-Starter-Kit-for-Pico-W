"""
MQTT Music Player with Keyboard Control

This program connects to an MQTT broker and plays predefined melodies
based on received messages. It includes graceful exit functionality
using keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C).

Hardware Requirements:
- ESP32/ESP8266 with MicroPython
- Buzzer connected to GPIO 15

Supported Songs:
- "nokia" - Nokia ringtone
- "starwars" - Star Wars theme
- "nevergonnagiveyouup" - Rick Astley
- "imperialmarch" - Imperial March (Darth Vader theme)

Usage:
- Send song name to MQTT topic 'LAFVIN MQTT'
- Use Ctrl+C to exit gracefully
