2.3 Door Bell
==========================

For this project we used a microswitch and an active buzzer to create a service bell. Tap the switch and the buzzer makes a sound.

Micro Switch is also a 3-pin device, the sequence of the 3 pins are C (common pin), NO (normally open) and NC (normally closed).

When the micro switch is not pressed, 1 (C) and 3 (NC) are connected together, when pressed 1 (C) and 2 (NO) are connected together.
