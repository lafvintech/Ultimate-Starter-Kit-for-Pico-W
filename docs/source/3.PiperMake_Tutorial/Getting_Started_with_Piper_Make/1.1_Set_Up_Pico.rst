In this step, you need to make sure that your Pico W is unplugged from your computer, as it needs to be plugged in in a specific way in the next step. Make sure your cable can handle power and data, as many micro USB cables only have power.

Now, press and hold the **RST** (white) button on the Pico W and plug the Pico W into your computer. Once plugged in, you can release the button.
